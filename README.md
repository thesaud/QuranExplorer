## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```git clone https://github.com/Son0fSun/QuranExplorer.git```

2. Install required Python packages (none beyond standard library):
   - The script uses only built-in modules (```xml.etree.ElementTree```, ```typing```, ```re```)

Note: The required XML database files (```quran_arabic.xml```, ```quran_english.xml```, ```quran_transliteration.xml```) are included in this repository.

```python QuranExplorer.py```

The main menu provides these options:
1. View specific verse by entering chapter and verse numbers
2. View entire chapter by chapter number
3. Search text in Arabic
4. Search text in English
5. Exit the program

### Example Commands
